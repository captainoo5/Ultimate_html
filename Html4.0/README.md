#Short Introduction to Html4
HTML 4, released in 1997, was a significant milestone in the evolution of HTML. It introduced various features that enhanced the web development process during that time.

One of the key improvements in HTML 4 was the introduction of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). CSS allowed developers to separate the presentation of a web page from its structure, making it easier to apply consistent styling across multiple pages. This separation of concerns improved the flexibility and maintainability of websites.

HTML 4 also introduced new form input types and attributes, expanding the capabilities of web forms. It provided support for text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown menus, and more. This allowed developers to create interactive and dynamic forms for user input.

Additionally, HTML 4 introduced several multimedia elements, such as the <video> and <audio> tags, which enabled the embedding and playback of video and audio content directly within web pages. This marked a significant advancement in web media capabilities.

HTML 4 also introduced the concept of framesets, which allowed for the division of a web page into multiple sections or frames. Each frame could contain different web pages or content, providing a way to display multiple sources of information simultaneously.

While HTML 4 laid the foundation for many modern web development practices, it lacked some of the features and semantic elements that are present in HTML 5. HTML 4 had limited support for multimedia, lacked semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, and <footer>, and had less robust support for accessibility features.

Despite its limitations, HTML 4 played a crucial role in shaping the web as we know it today and served as the standard for web development for many years before being succeeded by HTML 5.
