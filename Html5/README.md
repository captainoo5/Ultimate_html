**HTML5**
 The fifth and latest iteration of the HyperText Markup Language, represents a significant evolution in the world of web development. It builds upon the foundation laid by its predecessor, HTML4, but brings a multitude of improvements and new features that have revolutionized the way we create and experience web content.

HTML5 differs from HTML4 in several key ways, marking a substantial leap forward in terms of functionality, multimedia integration, and semantic structuring. Unlike HTML4, which primarily focused on defining the structure and presentation of web pages, HTML5 embraces a more holistic approach, emphasizing compatibility with modern web technologies and a greater emphasis on accessibility and user experience.
